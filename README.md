1. **Enter Message** ‚úçÔ∏è  
   Type or paste your plaintext (to encrypt) or ciphertext (to decrypt) into the top field.  
2. **Choose Shift Key** üî¢  
   Input an integer value indicating how many positions each letter should move.  
3. **Encrypt / Decrypt** üîÑ  
   ‚Ä¢ **Encrypt** shifts letters *forwards* by your key.  
   ‚Ä¢ **Decrypt** shifts them *backwards*.  
4. **View Result** üëÄ  
   The output box will display your transformed text instantly. Invalid or empty inputs trigger a friendly error popup.
